## Phase 1 — Client Loop (current focus)

The core client relationship loop: Bree onboards a client → client accesses portal → Bree and client communicate → Bree manages work.

### P1-A: Client invite flow

**Why:** Right now a client can only be linked to a portal account by manually inserting a `userId` into the DB. This is the biggest operational blocker — no real client can be onboarded without it.

**What to build:**

- `POST /v1/clients/:id/invite` — creates a better-auth user for the client's email, links `userId` to the client record, sends a welcome email via `@breeyard/mail.sendWelcome`
- CRM: "Send Invite" button on client detail page (only shown if `userId` is null)
- Portal: landing state when no client record found (graceful "account pending" message)
- Env vars needed: `PORTAL_URL` (server-side, for the invite link in the email)

**Send-from address:** `onboarding@8ofwands.com`
Set `MAIL_FROM="8 of Wands <onboarding@8ofwands.com>"` in the API container env.

**Devops must provision before P1-A can go live:**

- Stalwart: create `onboarding@8ofwands.com` mailbox (or alias → admin inbox)
- Stalwart: generate SMTP credentials for this address
- DNS (8ofwands.com): MX record pointing to dev-01, SPF, DKIM, DMARC
- API env: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `MAIL_FROM`, `PORTAL_URL`

**Dependencies:** `@breeyard/mail` ✅ already implemented

---

### P1-B: CRM message thread

**Why:** Portal clients can send messages. Bree has no way to read or reply in the CRM. The loop is half-open.

**What to build:**

- `GET /v1/clients/:id/messages` — list message thread for a client
- `POST /v1/clients/:id/messages` — Bree sends a reply (fromClient: false)
- CRM page: `apps/crm/src/routes/clients/[id]/messages/` — thread view + reply form
- CRM client detail: unread message count badge + link to thread

**Dependencies:** messages table ✅ already in schema

---

### P1-C: Email notifications on new message

**Why:** Neither Bree nor the client knows when the other sends a message unless they log in to check. `@breeyard/mail` is already fully implemented — this is just wiring.

**What to build:**

- When client sends a message via portal → email Bree at `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var
- When Bree replies via CRM → email the client (new `sendMessage` template, from `onboarding@8ofwands.com`)
- Both via `@breeyard/mail.send` directly — no queue needed at this scale

**Send-from address:** `onboarding@8ofwands.com` (same as invite — same Stalwart mailbox/alias)

**Dependencies:** P1-B (CRM reply route), `@breeyard/mail` ✅, Stalwart `onboarding@8ofwands.com` provisioned

---

## Phase 2 — Billing Basics

No invoices table exists yet. Invoices are visible in the architecture but fully unbuilt.

### P2-A: Invoices schema + API

- Add `invoices` table: `clientId`, `projectId`, `amountInCents`, `status` (draft/sent/paid/void), `dueAt`, `paidAt`, `description`, `lineItems (json)`
- `GET /v1/clients/:id/invoices` — list invoices for a client
- `POST /v1/clients/:id/invoices` — create invoice (CRM)
- `PATCH /v1/invoices/:id` — update status (mark paid, void, etc.)

### P2-B: CRM invoices page

- Replace the current stub with a real list + create form
- Client detail: invoice summary (total owed, last invoice status)

### P2-C: Portal invoice view

- `GET /v1/portal/invoices` — invoices for the logged-in client
- Portal route: `apps/portal/src/routes/invoices/` — read-only list with status badges

---

## Phase 3 — CMS End-to-End

CMS routes are scaffolded but the DB wiring is unverified. Web content is static/placeholder.

### P3-A: Smoke test CMS → web pipeline

- Verify CMS can create/edit a block and it renders on web
- Verify nav edits propagate to web
- Identify and fix any broken wiring

### P3-B: CMS auth guard

- Verify CMS login/auth guard is enforced (currently has login page, unclear if guard is applied globally)

---

## Phase 4 — Hardening

Once the client loop is closed and billing basics exist.

- `PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL` set in web deployment env (so Client Login button links to actual portal)
- Rate limiting on API auth routes (via `@breeyard/rate-limit` stub → implement)
- Audit log on key actions (invite sent, message sent, invoice created) via `@breeyard/audit`
- E2E tests for: invite flow, portal login, message send/receive, invoice view
- CRM auth guard — verify admin-only access is enforced end-to-end

---

## Email Infrastructure (devops prerequisite for P1-A/P1-C)

**Mail server:** Stalwart (already running on dev-01)
**Send-from:** `onboarding@8ofwands.com`

### Devops checklist

- [ ] Create `onboarding@8ofwands.com` in Stalwart (mailbox or alias forwarding to Bree's admin inbox)
- [ ] Generate SMTP credentials for `onboarding@8ofwands.com`
- [ ] DNS — 8ofwands.com:
  - [ ] MX record → dev-01 (or Stalwart hostname)
  - [ ] SPF — `v=spf1 include:<dev-01-ip> -all`
  - [ ] DKIM — generate key pair in Stalwart, publish public key as TXT record
  - [ ] DMARC — `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@8ofwands.com`
- [ ] Set API container env vars:
  - `SMTP_HOST` — Stalwart hostname
  - `SMTP_PORT` — 587 (STARTTLS)
  - `SMTP_SECURE` — false (STARTTLS, not SSL)
  - `SMTP_USER` — `onboarding@8ofwands.com`
  - `SMTP_PASS` — generated above
  - `MAIL_FROM` — `8 of Wands <onboarding@8ofwands.com>`
  - `PORTAL_URL` — `https://portal.8ofwands.com` (used in invite email link)
  - `ADMIN_EMAIL` — Bree's email (receives new-message notifications)
- [ ] Smoke test: send a test email via Stalwart admin or mailpit before P1-A goes live

## Deferred

- **Stripe billing** (`@breeyard/billing`) — payment processing, invoice payment links. After P2 is stable.
- **Client site generator** — extract this repo as a template, scaffold new client deployments. Requires both bwyard and artist-platform to be live and stable first.
- **`@breeyard/roles`** — role-based access beyond admin/client split. Not needed until multi-admin.
- **`@breeyard/i18n`**, **`@breeyard/gdpr`**, **`@breeyard/search`** — post-generator, per-client feature flags.
